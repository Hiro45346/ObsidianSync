Before tomorrow's class, I’d like you to download and install GoStats.
To run GoStats, your system must have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
If you need the JRE, it is available from Oracle as a free download. [Click here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) to visit Oracle's download site.

How to install Gostats
GoStats website: https://www.yorku.ca/mack/GoStats/index.html?GoStats.html
## Quick Start

1. [Click here](http://www.yorku.ca/mack/GoStats/GoStats.jar) to download GoStats.jar. Depending on your browser, you might need to right-click and select "Save link as...".
2. Put the JAR file in a directory somewhere in your workspace.
3. Double-click on the JAR file. GoStats launches and the home screen appears:
    
    > ![GoStats-1](https://www.yorku.ca/mack/GoStats/GoStats-1.png)
    
4. Click the radio button for the desired statistical test.
5. Click "Go".
If any of you encounter issues, I will guide you through the installation again 15 minutes before class.
